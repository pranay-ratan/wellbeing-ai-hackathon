# WellbeingAI Testing Results

## Original Problem Statement
Build "WellbeingAI" - a production-ready, multi-agent mental health crisis prediction system for Databricks hackathon. The system must leverage Databricks ecosystem (Delta Lake, Llama 70B, Vector Search) and process real CSV data to predict mental health crises through coordinated AI agents.

## Testing Protocol
- Test each agent independently before integration
- Validate Databricks connectivity and data pipeline
- Test multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph
- Verify privacy-preserving aggregation (k-anonymity)

## Current Status
**Phase:** Initial Setup - Starting Implementation

## Test History
No tests run yet.
